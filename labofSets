What You Need To Do:
Create a program that does the following:
Accept exactly one command-line argument that gives the name of your input file.
If the file specified on the command line does not exist, exit the program with an error message: Could not find input file.
Read in the file. It will contain two lines. The first line lists the elements in set A. The second line lists the elements in set B.
Print out eight results:
A in set notation
B in set notation
A ∩ B
A ∪ B
A – B
B – A
A × B
B × A
For full credit, format your answers so they look like sets. Namely, the commas and brackets should be correct. The cross-products should be sets of ordered pairs, with correct parentheses and commas.
This assignment is due in two parts. By the first deadline, you must AT LEAST be able to read in a file, and print out both sets. The rest of the program is due by the second deadline.
After you've finished the program:
Print up the cover pagePreview the document if you did not get one in class.
Upload your source code file to Canvas.
Demonstrate your program to a T.A. Please refer to the schedule on the door of GCB 111 for their office hours.
Sign your cover page, and turn it in to the TA.
Example:
Suppose the input file contained:

1 10 4
6 4
Your program should output:

A = {1, 10, 4}
B = {6, 4}
A intersect B = {4}
A union B = {1, 10, 4, 6}
A - B = {1, 10}
B - A = {6}
A x B = {(1,6), (1,4), (10,6), (10,4), (4,6), (4,4)}
B x A = {(6,1), (6,10), (6,4), (4,1), (4,10), (4,4)}
